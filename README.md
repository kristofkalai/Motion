# Motion
Motion management never was so easy on iOS! ðŸ‘‹

### How to use

You can use the manager like so:

```swift
MotionManager.accelerometer
    .shared
    .publisher
    .sink { data in
        // handle the data
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

Or if you don't prefer the Singleton pattern, then:

```swift
let accelerometer = MotionManager.accelerometer // this object must be retained (store it in the class)

accelerometer
    .publisher
    .sink { data in
        // handle the data
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

For details see the Example app.
